\arguments{
\item{fba_mat}{Matlab file .....}

\item{fba_model}{List representing the FBA model generated from *FBAfile.generation*.}

\item{S}{Stoic matrix}

\item{ub}{Vector of the upper constraint of the fluxes}

\item{lb}{Vector of the lower constraint of the fluxes}

\item{obj_fun}{Objective function to maximize. Vector of zeros with length equal to the number of reactions,
with one 1 in the position of the flux to maximize.}

\item{react_name}{The reactions name}

\details{
Problem: S*x = b -. size x = n and size of S = m X n
With this function the file to pass to the GLPKsolver is generated:
1st row) n_row n_col GLP_MAX (or GLP_MIN if the obj has to max or min)
2nd row) the coeff for defining the obj function (the number of coeff has to be == length of x)
m rows)   definition of the S row bounds (i.e. b)
n rows)   definition of the x bounds
m*n rows) definition of the S coeffs: row_index col_index value
