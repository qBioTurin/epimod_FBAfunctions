\title{Generate Stoichiometric Reaction Equations from a Metabolic Model}
\usage{
GenerateReactionEquations(
  model,
  makeClosedNetwork,
  entrydelim = ", ",
  extMetFlag = "b"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A metabolic model object with stoichiometric matrix \code{S},
metabolite IDs, and reaction bounds.}

\item{makeClosedNetwork}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, exchange reactions are made closed
by adding boundary metabolites.}

\item{entrydelim}{Character delimiter used when concatenating compartment annotations.
Defaults to ", ".}

\item{extMetFlag}{Character flag used to mark external/boundary metabolites. Defaults to "b".}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\describe{
\item{equat}{Character vector of reaction equations.}
\item{compat}{Character vector of compartment labels per reaction.}
\item{revers}{Character vector indicating reversibility ("Reversible" or "Irreversible").}
\item{metab}{Vector of cleaned metabolite IDs without compartment suffixes.}
}
}
\description{
This function constructs textual representations of reaction equations
from a metabolic model object. It considers reversibility, compartment annotations,
and can optionally create a closed network by adding boundary metabolites.

\examples{
\dontrun{
rxn_equations <- GenerateReactionEquations(model = my_model, makeClosedNetwork = TRUE)
head(rxn_equations$equat)
